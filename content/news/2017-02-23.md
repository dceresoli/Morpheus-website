The following new software packages have been installed and are
available with the `module` command:

- [Gollum](http://www.physics.lancs.ac.uk/gollum/) 1.1
- [PySCF](http://sunqm.github.io/pyscf/) git version\\
  PySCF is a powerfull and modern quantum chemistry code. It appears
  to be able to perform also FullCI, FCIQMC; MP2 and CCSD calculations
  for periodic systems! It can be used also from a Jupyter notebook
  (instructions will be posted soon!)
